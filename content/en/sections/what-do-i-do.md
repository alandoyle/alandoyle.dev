I write a _lot_ of code daily, some are utilities, others web sites, others yet are scripts in various languages, some are even useful! Some of these will be showcased here and made available on my [Github](https://github.com/alandoyle) page, others are usually one-hit wonders for a specific purpose so I'll only publish those if I think they may be of educational use.

I regularly use many languages on a daily basis...

- C
- C++
- C#
- MFC
- ASP.net
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- PHP
- SQL
- MySQL
- bash
- Powershell

... to name a few.

I'm not afraid to try other languages too and have been known to dabble in Python, Perl, Go and Rust.

I've written software for various flavours of Linux, as well as AIX 4.3 and up, SCO 4.2 and up and all versions of Windows and DOS.

All my software released [here](https://github.com/alandoyle) will be fully open-source.

I also enjoy tinkering with hardware. I build most of my PC's from hand-picked parts (except for laptops and Mini-PC's obviously) and prefer systems which are as silent as possible, this means I'm a big fan of [Noctua](https://noctua.at) fans (no pun intended). I also have been known to crack out the soldering iron and run up some PCB/board modifications when the need arises.
