# Who am I?

My name is Alan Doyle, no not this [Alan Doyle](https://alandoyle.ca). I'm a father to 2 beautiful daughters, I'm an Irish (Dublin born) Software Developer currently living in Birmingham, England.

I’ve been a Software Engineer for over 25 years now, initially working on embedded systems but currently writing cross-platform software to run on AIX, Linux, Open Server and Windows from a single common codebase for the Motor Trade.

My passion always was and always will be coding. I’ve been writing Software since I was 12 years old on the Commodore 64 my parents got me for Christmas, later I moved on to an Amiga 500 and Amiga 1200. However since I switched to PCs I’ve never been happy running Windows, I missed the passion Amiga coders had but now I’ve found that Open-Source software (particularly Linux) feeds that passion. 

To whit I switched permanently to Linux in 2005 to Ubuntu 5.04, I've tried dozens of distributions but I'm currently returned to Ubuntu 22.04, tweaked to my liking, on my laptop. I do have a Window 11 KVM with VGA passthrough enabled for games and work software though as I can't seem to escape Windows just yet.

I manage several VPS servers and enjoy working with LXD to containerize workloads. I like the machine-within-a-machine paradigm.

# What do I do?

I write a _lot_ of code daily, some are utilities, others web sites, others yet are scripts in various languages, some are even useful! Some of these will be showcased here and made available on my [Github](https://github.com/alandoyle) page, others are usually one-hit wonders for a specific purpose so I'll only publish those if I think they may be of educational use.

I regularly use many languages on a daily basis...

- C
- C++
- C#
- MFC
- ASP.net
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- PHP
- SQL
- MySQL
- bash
- Powershell

... to name a few.

I'm not afraid to try other languages too and have been known to dabble in Python, Perl, Go and Rust.

I've written software for various flavours of Linux, as well as AIX 4.3 and up, SCO 4.2 and up and all versions of Windows and DOS.

All my software released [here](https://github.com/alandoyle) will be fully open-source.

I also enjoy tinkering with hardware. I build most of my PC's from hand-picked parts (except for laptops and Mini-PC's obviously) and prefer systems which are as silent as possible, this means I'm a big fan of [Noctua](https://noctua.at) fans (no pun intended). I also have been known to crack out the soldering iron and run up some PCB/board modifications when the need arises.
